 Hii, I am a Graduate Student of Purdue University. I am currently doing my PhD in Computer Science . I recently moved to Purdue (Fall 2020) from The Ohio State University along with my advisor [Prof. Tamal Krishna Dey](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/). I am in CTDA group of Purdue CS dept. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Tele-communication Engineering from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in), Kolkata. My undergraduate research was in Circuits and Systems in ADESL lab under [Prof. Mrinal Kanti Naskar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t5kOc_EAAAAJ&hl=en). I am from the city of joy, Kolkata, situated in easteern part of India. Apart from doing nerdy stuff(Nerds call it research),I sometimes pick up my good old camera to click some photos.
