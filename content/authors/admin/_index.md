 Hii, I am a Graduate Student of Purdue University. I am currently doing my PhD in Computer Science . I recently moved to Purdue (Fall 2020) from The Ohio State University along with my advisor <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/" target="_blank">Prof. Tamal Krishna Dey</a>. I am in TGDA group of CSE dept. I am from Kolkata,the City of Joy. It is in the eastern part of India.</p>
<p> Apart from doing nerdy stuff(Nerds call it research),I sometimes pick up my good old camera to click some photos.Some of my photos.
